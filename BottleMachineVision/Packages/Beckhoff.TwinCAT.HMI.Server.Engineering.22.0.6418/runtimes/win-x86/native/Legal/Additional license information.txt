Lua


  Lua <https://www.lua.org/home.html> License

Lua is free software distributed under the terms of the MIT license
<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html> reproduced here.
Lua may be used for any purpose, including commercial purposes, at
absolutely no cost. No paperwork, no royalties, no GNU-like "copyleft"
restrictions, either. Just download <https://www.lua.org/download.html>
it and use it.

Lua is certified Open Source
<http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html> software. [osi
certified] <http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php> Its license
is simple and liberal and is compatible with GPL
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses>.
Lua is not in the public domain and PUC-Rio <http://www.puc-rio.br/>
keeps its copyright.

The spirit of the Lua license is that you are free to use Lua for any
purpose at no cost without having to ask us. The only requirement is
that if you do use Lua, then you should give us credit by including the
copyright notice somewhere in your product or its documentation. A nice,
but optional, way to give us further credit is to include a Lua logo
<https://www.lua.org/images/> and a link to our site
<http://www.lua.org/> in a web page for your product.

The Lua language is entirely designed, implemented, and maintained by a
team <https://www.lua.org/authors.html> at PUC-Rio
<http://www.puc-rio.br/> in Brazil. The implementation is not derived
from licensed software.

Before Lua 5.0, Lua used its own license, which was very close to the
zlib license <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.html> and
others, but not quite the same. Check the source distribution
<https://www.lua.org/ftp/> for the exact license text for each version
before Lua 5.0. Nevertheless, if you wish to use those old versions, you
may hereby assume that they have all been re-licensed under the MIT
license as described above.

  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
